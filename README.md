# chaple-python-zeromq
Attempts to cross the python / chapel divide with ZeroMQ

This currently works w/ Python to Python and Chapel to Chapel, not communicating yet. Almost certainly something stupid I did

Got some good advice on the [SO Post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45651724/zeromq-w-chapel-and-python-cannot-answer-in-current-state/45654811#45654811)
